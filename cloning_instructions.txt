Here are the step-by-step instructions for harshitkumar725@gmail.com to clone the cloudOS repository.

### Prerequisites:
- Git must be installed on their machine.
- They should have a GitHub account and accept the collaborator invitation (check email from GitHub).
- For SSH cloning, they need SSH keys set up (recommended).

### Step 1: Accept the Collaborator Invitation
1. Check the email from GitHub inviting them to collaborate on Abhishekpan731/cloudOS.
2. Click "Accept invitation" in the email or go to https://github.com/Abhishekpan731/cloudOS and accept the invite.

### Step 2: Set Up Authentication
#### Option A: SSH (Recommended)
1. Open a terminal on their machine.
2. Check if SSH keys exist: ls -la ~/.ssh/
3. If no keys, generate one: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "harshitkumar725@gmail.com"
4. Copy the public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
5. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.
6. Paste the key and save.
7. Test SSH: ssh -T git@github.com (should show "Hi harshitkumar725! You've successfully authenticated...")

#### Option B: HTTPS (Alternative)
- Use GitHub personal access token for authentication.
- Create a token at GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token (select repo scope).

### Step 3: Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the desired directory: cd /path/to/your/projects
3. Clone using SSH (if set up):
   git clone git@github.com:Abhishekpan731/cloudOS.git
   Or using HTTPS:
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishekpan731/cloudOS.git
4. Enter credentials if prompted (for HTTPS, use username harshitkumar725 and the personal access token as password).

### Step 4: Switch to Harshit_dev Branch
After cloning:
cd cloudOS
git checkout Harshit_dev

### Step 5: Verify Access
- They can push to Harshit_dev directly: git push origin Harshit_dev
- For other branches, they'll need to create pull requests.

If they encounter any issues (e.g., permission denied), ensure they've accepted the invitation and set up authentication correctly.
