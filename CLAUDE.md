# CloudOS Development Notes

## Phase 1 Status
✅ Project structure created
✅ Basic microkernel architecture implemented
✅ Boot loader and initialization system ready
✅ Memory management implemented
✅ Process management implemented

## Build Issues
The current build system encounters cross-compilation challenges on macOS:
- Need x86_64 cross-compiler toolchain
- macOS linker doesn't support GNU linker script format
- NASM assembly works correctly

## Next Steps
1. Set up proper cross-compilation toolchain OR
2. Create Docker-based build environment OR
3. Continue development and test on Linux VM

## Current Implementation
- Microkernel with basic VGA output
- Simple heap allocator with kmalloc/kfree
- Process management with scheduling framework
- Boot sequence with long mode support
- Ready for Phase 2: AI integration

## Testing
To test the current build:
```bash
# Install cross-compiler (if available)
brew install x86_64-elf-gcc x86_64-elf-binutils

# OR use Docker
docker run -v $(pwd):/work -w /work ubuntu:20.04 bash -c "
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential nasm
  make kernel
"
```
