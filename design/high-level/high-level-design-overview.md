## Design Principles

### CloudOS Core Principles
1. **Microkernel Architecture** - Minimal kernel with services in user space
2. **Cloud-Native Design** - Optimized for cloud and distributed environments
3. **Security by Design** - Built-in security at every layer
4. **Modular Architecture** - Pluggable components and services
5. **Cross-Platform Support** - Multiple architecture support (x86_64, ARM64)

### Design Guidelines
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between system layers
- **Loose Coupling** - Minimal dependencies between components
- **High Cohesion** - Related functionality grouped together
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new features and capabilities
- **Testability** - Designed for comprehensive testing and validation
