# CloudOS Design Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive design documentation for CloudOS, organized into high-level and low-level design specifications.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ High-Level Design (`high-level/`)
Strategic and architectural documentation focusing on system-wide concepts:

- **`architecture/`** - System architecture diagrams and overall design patterns
- **`system-overview/`** - System overview, components interaction, and data flow
- **`requirements/`** - Functional and non-functional requirements documentation
- **`interfaces/`** - External interfaces, APIs, and integration specifications

### üìÅ Low-Level Design (`low-level/`)
Detailed technical implementation documentation:

- **`modules/`** - Individual module designs and implementation details
- **`algorithms/`** - Algorithm specifications and complexity analysis
- **`data-structures/`** - Data structure definitions and relationships
- **`apis/`** - Internal API specifications and function signatures
- **`diagrams/`** - Technical diagrams, flowcharts, and UML designs

## Design Process

1. **High-Level Design First** - Start with architectural decisions and system requirements
2. **Low-Level Design Details** - Break down into specific implementation details
3. **Iterative Refinement** - Update both levels as implementation evolves
4. **Traceability** - Maintain links between high-level concepts and low-level implementations

## Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include diagrams in Mermaid format where possible
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Maintain version history for design changes
- Include code examples and references to implementation files

## Current Status

CloudOS Phase 1 implementation is complete. Design documentation will capture:
- ‚úÖ Microkernel Architecture
- ‚úÖ Memory Management System
- ‚úÖ Process Scheduling Design
- ‚úÖ Network Stack Architecture
- ‚úÖ Security Framework Design
- ‚úÖ File System Architecture
